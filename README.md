# About
Navi-Rides is a ride listing platform that connects riders with drivers to reduce carpooling costs and environmental impact. <br/>
Navi-Rides is easy to use. Riders simply create an account and list their ride, specifying the destination, departure time, and number of seats available. Drivers can then browse the listings and contact riders who are going their way. Once a ride is booked, the driver and rider can communicate directly to arrange the pickup and drop-off locations.<br/>
Navi-Rides is a great way to save money and reduce your environmental impact. It's also a convenient way to meet new people and make new friends.
